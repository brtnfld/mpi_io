Sample_mpio_measure_time.c -- independent IO 
Sample_mpio_measure_time_collective.c - collective IO

0. Simulate 9-variable Generic IO.

1. Compile
   mpicc Sample_***.c
2. Run 
For the interleaved pattern
   mpirun -np 4 ./a.out -i
For the contiguous pattern
   mpirun -np 4 ./a.out -c

3. File Size
The output file size is 45GB.

To change the file size, edit the Sample_***.c,
change the following line:

    int64_t  buf_size = 5368709120LL;

to your own number.

4. For collective IO, the following MPI hints are added. They can be commented out as needed.
    MPI_Info_set(info,"romio_cb_write","enable");
    MPI_Info_set(info,"cray_cb_write_lock_mode","2");
    MPI_Info_set(info,"cray_cb_nodes_multiplier","2");
